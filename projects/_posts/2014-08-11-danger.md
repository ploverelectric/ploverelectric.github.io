The Danger Shield 2.0 is a new remix of an old design. It started with Zach Hoeken's original [Danger Shield v1.0](http://www.zachhoeken.com/danger-shield-v1-0) back in 2008, which was an awesome Arduino shield for exploring various human interactions. SparkFun released a [modified version](https://github.com/sparkfun/DangerShield) in 2012. Danger Shield 2.0 has the same great interactions as the original (sliders, LEDs, buttons, etc.) but instead of a plain-jane Arduino shield, our version has headers for a [Spark Core](https://spark.io), a tiny, Arduino compatible, Wifi-enabled microcontroller that makes it easy to connect your Danger Shield 2.0 to the Internet.

What is it for? Whatever you want to do with it!

##### Features

* Three slide potentiometers with large buttons underneath
* One 7-segment LED display with 8-bit shift register
* One TMP36 temperature sensor
* One miniature photocell for light detection
* Three LEDs (Red/Yellow/Green)
* One piezo buzzer
* Extra headers for expanding your shift register and attaching additional components
* One Capacitive touch sensor, on the lower right corner
* Spark Core makes it easy to write Arduino-compatible software that connects your Danger Shield to the Internet

##### Totally Hackable

* Open-source hardware, firmware, and software make the Danger Shield 2.0 easy to use and easy to modify
* The Spark Core (also open source) makes it easy to control things over the Internet, right from your Danger Shield
* Extra pins are broken out to a header on the side - easily add your own buttons, sensors, LEDs, or even communicate with other circuits

##### Available Configurations

The Danger Shield 2.0 comes as a kit, ready to assemble and start affecting awesomeness. You will need a soldering iron, but this project is totally doable for a first-timer. Basic Arduino experience is recommended but not to worry, we have have some cool pre-made programs you can use. Warning: this board it totally awesome. Prepare to rock.

##### Open Source

All the hardware and software for the Danger Shield 2.0 is released under open source licenses and is completely hackable. The Spark Core used is also open source, so you can hack that too. You can even grab our design files for EAGLE and design your own version of the Danger Shield (please let us know if you do, we'd love to see!)

##### Quality

All of our boards are lovingly designed, built, and tested right here in Brooklyn, New York. Our products are all lead free and RoHS compliant. 

##### Acknowledgments

The Danger Shield 2.0 is an iteration on a design credited to Chris Taylor at [SparkFun](https://www.sparkfun.com/products/11649), which is itself based on an original design by [Zach Hoeken](http://www.zachhoeken.com/danger-shield-v1-0). As the SparkFun design is released under the CC-BY-SA 3.0 license, so is this one.
